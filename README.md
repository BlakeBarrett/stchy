## Stitch multiple Gifs together into one video to share. Powered by GIPHY!


Written in response to the [Eaze iOS "homework"](https://github.com/eaze/ios-homework) as a part of the interview process. 
The prompt is to write an app that utilizes the Giphy search API, does _anything_ and uses only programmatic layout.
I usually prefer to use the tools each platform provides (in this case Storyboards and xibs) but felt it an interesting handicap.

The code is not perfect, but I am trying to keep it neat and clean (_ish_).
This codebase as well as the ones for [mrgr](https://github.com/BlakeBarrett/mrgr-swift), [mskr](https://github.com/BlakeBarrett/mskr-swift) and others are good representations of what my coding style is / what you can expect from me. 


Remaining **TODO** items:   
 * Progress indicators
 * Cache downloaded Giphy-gifs
 * Screen shots for App Store
 * App icon
 * "Production Key" from Giphy 


Thank you,
Blake
