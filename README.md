This was written in response to the [Eaze iOS "homework"](https://github.com/eaze/ios-homework) as a part of the interview process. 
The prompt is to write an app that utilizes the Giphy search API, does _anything_ and uses only programmatic layout.
I usually prefer to use the tools each platform provides (in this case Storyboards and xibs) but felt it an interesting handicap.

Code is not perfect, but I am trying to keep it neat and clean (_ish_).
This codebase as well as the ones for [mrgr](https://github.com/BlakeBarrett/mrgr-swift), [mskr](https://github.com/BlakeBarrett/mskr-swift) and others are good representations of what my coding style is / what you can expect from me. 

Thank you,
Blake
